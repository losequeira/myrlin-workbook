## Quick Start

### Try it now

```bash
npx myrlin-workbook          # Opens browser, discovers your real Claude sessions
npx myrlin-workbook --demo   # Opens browser with sample data (no real sessions needed)
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/therealarthur/myrlin-workbook.git
cd myrlin-workbook
npm install
npm run gui                   # Real sessions
npm run gui:demo              # Sample data
```

### Password

On first launch, a random password is generated and saved to `~/.myrlin/config.json`. This password **persists across updates, reinstalls, and npx cache clears** — you'll always use the same password.

To set your own:

```bash
# Option 1: Edit the config file (recommended — persists forever)
# ~/.myrlin/config.json → { "password": "your-password-here" }

# Option 2: Environment variable (overrides config, per-session)
CWM_PASSWORD=mypassword npx myrlin-workbook
```

Password lookup order: `CWM_PASSWORD` env var > `~/.myrlin/config.json` > `./state/config.json` > auto-generate.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** ([download](https://nodejs.org))
- **C++ Build Tools** (required by `node-pty` for real terminal emulation):
  - **Windows**: [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with "Desktop development with C++" workload
  - **macOS**: `xcode-select --install`
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt install build-essential python3`

> **`npm install` fails?** You're missing the C++ build tools above. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Run Modes

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx myrlin-workbook` | Web GUI via npx |
| `npm run gui` | Web GUI (localhost:3456) |
| `npm run gui:demo` | Web GUI with sample data |
| `npm start` | TUI mode (terminal-only, blessed) |
| `npm run demo` | TUI with sample data |

## Why

I use Claude Code daily and had a growing list of pet peeves. Can't name sessions, so `/resume` is just picking from a list of IDs. No shift+enter for multiline. If you have a few sessions going at once, the terminal window juggling gets old fast. PC restarts and you have to reopen everything from scratch. No idea what you're spending.

Got fed up and built something for it. Myrlin scans `~/.claude/projects/`, finds every session you've ever run, and you organize them into workspaces with embedded terminals, docs, and cost tracking. Everything runs locally, no cloud, no telemetry.

### Compared to other tools

There are good tools in this space. I tried them. Here's where Myrlin fits:

| Feature | Myrlin | [ClaudeCodeUI](https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui) | [Opcode](https://github.com/winfunc/opcode) | [Claude Squad](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad) |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Cost tracking | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Costs dashboard | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Session discovery | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Session manager overlay | Yes | No | No | No |
| Workspace docs/kanban | Yes | No | No | No |
| Themes | 13 (Catppuccin, Nord, Dracula, etc.) | No | No | No |
| Session templates | Yes | No | No | No |
| Conflict detection | Yes | No | No | No |
| Embedded terminals | 4-pane grid | Single | No | No |
| Tab grouping | Yes | No | No | No |
| Windows native | Yes | Buggy | Yes (desktop) | No (tmux) |
| TUI mode | Yes | No | No | No |
| Multi-agent | Claude only | Claude+Cursor+Codex | Claude only | 5+ tools |
| File explorer | No | Yes | No | No |
| npx install | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Build step required | None | Vite | Tauri | None |

**What those tools do better:** ClaudeCodeUI has a file explorer and multi-agent support. Opcode is a polished desktop app with 20k stars. Claude Squad supports 5+ AI tools. Myrlin is workspace-first with cost tracking and per-workspace docs. Different approach to the same problem.

## Features

### Cost Tracking

Per-session and per-workspace cost breakdown. Parses Claude's JSONL usage data, applies model-aware pricing (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), shows input/output/cache tokens. Know exactly what you're spending.

### Session Discovery

- Scans `~/.claude/projects/` and finds all existing Claude sessions
- Shows project directory, session count, size, last active
- Auto-titles sessions from conversation content
- Import sessions into workspaces with one click

### Workspaces & Sessions

![Workspace dashboard with sessions grouped by project](docs/images/hero-dashboard.png)

- Named workspaces with color coding
- Group workspaces under umbrella folders
- Drag-and-drop sessions between workspaces and into terminal panes
- State persists to disk. Survives crashes and restarts
- Auto-recovery on startup (detects orphaned sessions, restores state)

### Embedded Terminals

![4-pane terminal grid with concurrent sessions](docs/images/terminal-grid.png)

- 4-pane terminal grid (xterm.js + node-pty + WebSocket). Real PTY, not fake.
- Tab groups: named sets of terminal panes ("Research", "Debug"), switchable and persistent
- PTY sessions survive page refresh with scrollback replay on reconnect
- Model selection (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) and session resume
- Right-click context menu with Copy, Stop, Restart, Model picker

### Per-Workspace Docs & Feature Board

![Docs panel with Notes, Goals, Tasks, Roadmap, and Rules](docs/images/docs-panel.png)

![Switching between workspace docs](docs/images/workspace-docs.gif)

- Notes, Goals, Tasks, Rules, and Roadmap sections per workspace
- Kanban-style feature board (Planned -> Active -> Review -> Done)
- Markdown editor with formatting toolbar
- AI Insights tab: auto-generated summaries of workspace sessions

![Feature tracking Kanban board](docs/images/kanban-board.png)

### Session Templates

Save your common launch configurations. Pre-set working directory, model, flags, and spawn options. One click to launch a new session from a template.

### Conflict Detection

Real-time warnings when two or more running sessions are editing the same files. Runs `git status` across active sessions and cross-references modified files. Prevents you from stepping on your own work.

### Quick Switcher

`Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K` opens a fuzzy search across all sessions and workspaces. Jump to anything instantly.

### Git & Worktree Management

- Full git status per workspace: current branch, dirty/clean, ahead/behind remote
- Branch listing and worktree CRUD
- **"New Feature Session"**: right-click a workspace -> creates a branch + worktree + Claude session in one click
- Branch badges on session rows

### Themes

![All 4 Catppuccin themes: Mocha, Macchiato, Frappe, and Latte](docs/images/theme-showcase.png)

![Theme switching in action](docs/images/theme-switching.gif)

13 themes organized into Dark and Light sections. 4 official [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) (Mocha, Macchiato, Frappe, Latte), 3 community favorites (Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night), 4 custom flavors (Cherry, Ocean, Amber, Mint), and 2 light alternatives (Rose Pine Dawn, Gruvbox Light). Toggle from the header dropdown. Choice persists in localStorage.

### Port Detection & Resource Monitoring

- Automatic port detection for running sessions (PowerShell on Windows, lsof on Unix)
- Per-session CPU and memory tracking
- System overview (CPU, RAM, uptime)
- Stop, restart, or kill sessions from the Resources tab

### Mobile

## Troubleshooting

### `npm install` fails with node-gyp errors
`node-pty` needs C++ build tools to compile native bindings. Install the tools listed in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

**Windows quick fix:**
```powershell
npm install -g windows-build-tools
```

### `npx myrlin-workbook` hangs on install
Same issue. node-pty is compiling. If it fails, install the C++ build tools first, then try again.

**Still stuck?** Open an [issue](https://github.com/therealarthur/myrlin-workbook/issues) with your full error output and OS version.
