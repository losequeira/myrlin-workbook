## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Visual QA MCP Server** (`src/mcp/visual-qa.js`) — gives Claude "eyes and hands" for web UI development via Chrome DevTools Protocol. 4 tools: `screenshot`, `query_dom`, `execute_js`, `list_targets`. Works with any browser or Electron app that exposes a CDP debugging port.
- **`--cdp` flag** for GUI launcher — `npm run gui:cdp` launches browser with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` so the Visual QA MCP can connect automatically.
- **`npm run mcp:visual-qa`** script to run the MCP server standalone.
- `chrome-remote-interface` dependency for lightweight CDP access (~50KB).
- Registered `visual-qa` MCP server globally in Claude Code settings.
- Added Visual QA workflow documentation to global CLAUDE.md for use across all web/UI projects.
